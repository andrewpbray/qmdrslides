## Introduction

This is `inline code`. Here's a code block:

```{r}
#| echo: true
a <- 1 + 1
rnorm(a)
```


This is what a blockquote looks like:

> Wisdom incarnate.

## Other classes

This is an example of the [filename]{.filename} class (distinct from verbatim code). Another is a the `.poll` class that you can just to wrap a div

Like this.

You can also class images with `.drop` to get an effect similar to the macosx window screenshot.
